## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seva3l/Map-Notes
   cd mapnotes
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed.
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   Create an `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Mapbox and Firebase configuration:
   ```
   MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token
   ```
   You can obtain a Mapbox token from [https://account.mapbox.com/](https://account.mapbox.com/)
   Firebase configuration can be found in your Firebase project settings.

4. **Run the App:**
   To run the app on an Android/iOS simulator:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

## Usage

- **Authentication**: Sign up or log in using your email and password.
- **Viewing Notes**: Notes will be displayed as markers on the map. Tap a marker to view the note details.
- **Adding Notes**: Long press on the map to create a new note at the selected location. Add a title, description, and optionally upload an image.
- **Editing Notes**: Open a note from the map and modify its details. Changes will be automatically synced to Firestore.
- **Deleting Notes**: Remove notes by selecting them from the map and using the delete option. This will remove the note from Firestore and any associated image from Firebase Storage.

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage in the Firebase console.
3. Set up security rules for Firestore and Storage to ensure data protection.
4. Add your Firebase configuration to the `.env` file as shown in the Setup & Installation section.
